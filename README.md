**Project Page:** 

**Instructions for use:** 
When the user clicks on the app logo they will be directed to the menu. The menu has three buttons.
The play button that directs you to the game board where the two players enter their names and start playing. '
The demo button that directs you to the demo video, which explains how to play a game. The last button is the exit button that exits the game if you do not want to play anymore.

**Tools used:**
We used android studios to create our project, to design the interface of the game we used Canva and android studios, for our demo video we used CapCut. 
We pushed our code to GitHub and all the changes. For our Project proposal and the README file we used Microsoft Word. Some of our code was written in notepad ++.

**Concepts used:**
In our project we created custom classes, namely AddPlayers, Demo, Display, Results and the MainActivity.
The player class is mostly about adding your players and entering the player names and it mostly uses string manipulation when the user enters the name of the player. 
The demo class is a custom class that makes use of media playback, resources as well as intents.
The display class has demonstrated use of different imports to allow us to work with intents and views. We have utilized event handling through our onClick method. 
Our mainActivity class has utulized a variety of concepts, apart from the ones mentioned above, this class uses conditional statements when controing player turns and checking for a winner.
It uses lists when storing different combinations in which a player can win. Arrays are also used to store players turn.
This activity also utilizes the calling of different methods.
Our results class demonstrates inheritence through the use of the indicator 'extends'.


**Assumptions:**
The assumption is that there would be two human players that would insert their player names within the game and continue to the gameboard.
Once they are there, they will take turns placing either an 'X' or an 'O', on a 3x3 grid, hoping that a player will successfully fill a row or column with the same symbol.
If either player is able to do this and all the squares within the grid are filled, there is a draw.
In either case, the users will either be propted with a message that a player has won or the match has been drawn.
They can then either choose to play again, go back to the menu, or exit the app in its entirety.

**Limitations:**
The limitations are that the player cannot play against the computer, and you can only include two players.
Another limitation is that the game only uses a 3x3 board and the board be increased.
